                <p>Throughout my academic life, I strive to develop myself and seize every opportunity. I excel in programming languages and I'm always happy to complete given assignments. In order to accelerate my own development process, I take online courses, practice on websites like Leetcode, and work on small projects by myself.

                    Aside from university, my interests and hobbies include horseback riding, hiking, camping, swimming, woodworking, listening to music, and spending time with my friends.
                    <br><br>
                    I have an open-minded personality and have always been interested in developing new projects and ideas since childhood. I can communicate easily with people and have self-confidence to address large groups and give speeches. I enjoy researching topics related to software development, artificial intelligence, full stack web development.</p>
